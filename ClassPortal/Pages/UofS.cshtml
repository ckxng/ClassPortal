This is a hard-coded page that is specific to Longhorn Council UofS in 2021.
If this software package is utilized by another council, then this page should
be either removed or adapted to fit the specific needs of that council.

The CollegeId of 2 specified here matches the SeedData created by the
EF database migration.  If a different CollegeId is used in production, that
will need to be adjusted or fixed to look up dynamically.
